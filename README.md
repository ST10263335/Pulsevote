For ICE Task 3, I researched popular live polling platforms such as Kahoot, Mentimeter, Google Forms, and Strawpoll to understand their features and common security issues like bot attacks, cheating, and privacy risks. I then scaffolded the PulseVote backend using Express with Helmet, CORS, dotenv, and a basic server route to establish secure foundations, while preparing folders for models, routes, controllers, and middleware. In parallel, I created the frontend with Vite React, replacing the default page with a simple interface that successfully fetched and displayed the backendâ€™s health check message. This task emphasized the importance of security in real-time polling apps, ensuring that both the backend and frontend were set up with good coding hygiene and ready for further secure development.
